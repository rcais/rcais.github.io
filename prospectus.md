<h1>Sponsorship Prospectus</h1>

The Summit on Responsible Computing, AI, and Society is deeply grateful to our sponsors who provide funds that are essential to the success of the event. An important use of those funds is the support of the next generation of AI researchers who receive mentorship, networking, opportunities, and learning opportunities through the Doctoral Consortium. We also provide financial assistance as needed to junior researchers to facilitate an inclusive and diverse scientific community.  We stress the scientific mission of the conference, to foster the exchange of research advances.


Sponsorship levels:

- Gold: Greater to or equal to $10,000
- Silver: From $5,000 to $10,000

Silver sponsorship and above is recognized with: logos on website, print materials, and acknowledgement in the opening and closing sessions; ability to disseminate print materials to summit participants; and an offer for a few minutes of time to address participants. Gold sponsors may ask for consideration of additional forms of engagement, to be negotiated.  

Please reach out to Mark Riedl (riedl@cc.gatech.edu) for consideration of other level options.
