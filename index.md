<h1>Doctoral Consortium</h1>

The Summit will feature a Doctoral Consortium on October 27th, 2025, which will offer Ph.D. students opportunities to introduce their research to the broader research community, and receive mentorship, and constructive input.  We are looking for individuals just before, or just after, their PhD proposal defense who are working in the area of human-centered AI, responsible AI, responsible computing, sustainability (environmental or community), or health. 

Please see the <a href="/doctoral-consortium">Doctoral Consortium</a> page for information about how to apply.

<h1>Venue</h1>

The Summit will take place at the Georgia Tech Academy of Medicine historical building in Midtown Atlanta, Georgia. It is very near to the School of Interactive Computing and the GT Machine Learning Center.

<h1>Partner Event</h1>
