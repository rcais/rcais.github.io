The Georgia Tech <a href="https://ic.gatech.edu/">School of Interactive Computing</a> is hosting the <strong>2025 Summit on Responsible Computing, AI, and Society</strong>, October 27-29, 2025.

<h1>Overview</h1>

The Summit on Responsible Computing, AI, and Society aims to explore the future of computing for health, sustainability, human-centered AI, and policy. The summit will bring together luminary researchers in computing for health, sustainability, human-centered AI, and tech policy to lay out the frontiers of these critical fields, and to plot out how they must evolve. 

Please see the <a href="/cfp">Call for Contributions</a>

Dr. Rumman Chowdhury’s passion lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and humanity. She is a pioneer in the field of applied algorithmic ethics, creating cutting-edge socio-technical solutions for ethical, explainable and transparent AI. She is CEO and co-founder of Humane Intelligence, and the first person to be appointed by the Department of State as the United States Science Envoy for Artificial Intelligence. Previously, Dr. Chowdhury was the Director of META (ML Ethics, Transparency, and Accountability) team at Twitter, leading a team of applied researchers and engineers to identify and mitigate algorithmic harms on the platform. Prior to Twitter, she was CEO and founder of Parity, an enterprise algorithmic audit platform company. She formerly served as Global Lead for Responsible AI at Accenture Applied Intelligence. In her work as Accenture’s Responsible AI lead, she led the design of the Fairness Tool, a first-in-industry algorithmic tool to identify and mitigate bias in AI systems. She is an active contributor to discourse around responsible technology. Chowdhury holds two undergraduate degrees from MIT, a master's degree in Quantitative Methods of the Social Sciences from Columbia University, and a doctorate in political science from the University of California, San Diego.

<h1>Doctoral Consortium</h1>

The Summit will feature a Doctoral Consortium, which will offer Ph.D. students opportunities to introduce their research to the broader research community, and receive mentorship, and constructive input.  We are looking for individuals just before, or just after, their PhD proposal defense who are working in the area of human-centered AI, responsible AI, responsible computing, sustainability (environmental or community), or health. Please inquire with the organizers for more information.

<h1>Venue</h1>

The Summit will take place at the Georgia Tech Academy of Medicine historical building in Midtown Atlanta, Georgia. It is very near to the School of Interactive Computing and the GT Machine Learning Center.





<h1>Sponsors</h1>

The Summit graciously thanks its sponsors for proving support for the Doctoral Consortium.
